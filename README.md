Introduction
-
   AiR Defence is an iOS game that utilises augmented reality to give you the impression that enemy aircraft are zeroing in on your location and attacking you. You must defend yourself using your missiles and flares, with in-game scores being calculated based on the number of missiles you use, the number of times you are hit by enemy projectiles, and the number of enemies that are destroyed.

   Players can view their scores on the Rankings page and see how their scores stack up against other players'.
